### Coding Task - Build a Shopping List App &amp
---
Brief: In this task you and your team are required to build a basic shopping list app. <br>
Assumptions:
1. Will use HTML, Bootstrap and Java to build a web app.
2. Use JavaScript to add new enties to the html DOM.
3. Less is more, one text input for the item, a number field for quantity and one button to insert item into the DOM.
Once we have at least one item in list, we have a readout of the item, and quantity. Also add a delete button.
4. Keep testing in mind while programming (data-cy attributes) <br>

For Future Releases:
1. Make it simple to modify items on list - change name/quantity
2. Add an option where you can tick te item once in basket, so it is reusable as there's no need to delete it.


### Testing Task - Test the Basic Shopping List App
---
Things to test:
1. are there two input fields, and a button?
2. can you type into the input fields?
3. is the button clickable?
4. a) once data is inserted, does it show up on the list? <br>
   b) is there a delete button next to our item, can it be clicked? does it work as intended?
